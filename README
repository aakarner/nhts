This script downloads raw data from the National Household Transportation Survey for 2009 and imports them into a MonetDB database before creating a complex survey object for later analysis.

Future versions will include importation of other analysis years and illustrate analytical possibilities.

This work draws heavily from Anthony Damico's scripts that analyze other US government survey data.
