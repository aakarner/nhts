NHTS analysis script
====================

**Note: These scripts have been superseded by a more complete set on [Anthony Damico's usgsd project site](https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/tree/master/National%20Household%20Travel%20Survey).**

This script downloads raw data from the National Household Transportation Survey for 2009 and imports them into a MonetDB database before creating a complex survey object for later analysis.

Future versions will include importation of other analysis years and illustrate analytical possibilities.

This work draws heavily from [Anthony Damico's scripts](https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd) that analyze other US government survey data.
